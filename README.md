# dnanexus_ED_cnv_calling
Performs CNV calling using ExomeDepth.

# How the app works?

The app takes in a readcount file generated by https://github.com/moka-guys/dnanexus_ED_readcount_analysis, The docker image will pick the most appropriate reference samples and run exomedepth for a given sample. 

For further details on the usage of the docker image please refer to https://github.com/moka-guys/seglh-cnv/tree/main/exomedepth

# Input
DNAnexus project name where the BAM and the indexes are stored
Reference genome in build 37
Readcount file generated using https://github.com/moka-guys/dnanexus_ED_readcount_analysis
QC file containing QC parameters
List of comma seperated pan numbers
Test specific BED file

# Output
Exomedepth
output.pdf - Exomedepth CNV report with all QC information
output.bed - CNVs in BED format (whole panel)
output.vcf - CNVs in VCF format (whole panel, with out-of-scope filter tags, see VCF file header)
