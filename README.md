# dnanexus_ED_cnv_calling
Performs CNV calling using ExomeDepth.

# How the app works?

The app takes in a readcount file generated by https://github.com/moka-guys/dnanexus\_ED\_readcount_analysis, the docker image will pick the most appropriate reference samples and run exomedepth for a given sample. 


For further details on the usage of the docker image please refer to https://github.com/moka-guys/seglh-cnv/tree/main/exomedepth

# Input
- DNAnexus project name where the BAM and the indexes are stored (BAMs/BAIs MUST be present in the /output folder)
- Readcount file generated using https://github.com/moka-guys/dnanexus\_ED\_readcount_analysis
- QC file containing QC parameters (Optional) - generated using https://github.com/moka-guys/dnanexus\_ED\_readcount_analysis
- List of comma seperated pan numbers (Pan4127,Pan4129,Pan4130,Pan4049)
- Test specific BED file
See CLI command below for an example of inputs.

# Output
- output.pdf - Exomedepth CNV report with all QC information
- output.tex - Intermediate file used to create PDF
- tables-1.pdf, tables-2.pdf etc - Plots for inclusion in the generated reports
- output.bed - CNVs in BED format (whole panel)
- output.RData 

# Running from the CLI:

The app can be run from the dx CLI.  The example below shows the code used to run test samples through this app:

```bash
dx run project-G0pKxX80pgqFk9Vy8p6vQbKv:applet-G7B5Zxj0pgq9Q8JfP0jpY3y4 -iproject_name=003_220103_exomeDepth_calling_test -ireadcount_file=project-G6jb1k807Xjj1J984K6kfP13:file-G6kg5q80gvvz37qZ4ZPbvZ8Q -ibamfile_pannumbers=Pan4127,Pan4129,Pan4130,Pan4049 -isubpanel_bed=project-ByfFPz00jy1fk6PjpZ95F27J:file-G6kZpqQ0jy1q1Zk94G3qbVyV -iQC_file=project-G6jb1k807Xjj1J984K6kfP13:file-G66X1Z80p6PG52GFK4zfpY7y

```
# Debugging

For debugging issues with the `docker` image it can be helpful to `ssh` into a 'held for debugging' job in DNA nexus and run the `docker` image in interactive mode:

```bash
docker run -v /home/dnanexus:/home/dnanexus/ --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash seglh/exomedepth:1220d31
```
